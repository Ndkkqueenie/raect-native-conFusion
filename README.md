## Resturante conFusion

I made this project during my professional specialization with the Hong Kong University of Science and Tech through Cousera. It is an Android mobile app for Resturant. It was built with React Native, Redux, Expo, Express, Nodejs and MongoDB. It's not on google apps and the APK for it has expired(only valid for 30 days). Please view locally on development mode.
